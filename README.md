    <br/> A Utility plugin for Roblox Studio similar to of Blender's basic loop cut implementation
</p>


# Installation:
#### Method 1: [Roblox library](https://www.roblox.com/library/7158238819/LoopCut)
#### Method 2: [latest release](https://github.com/KhanPython/LoopCut/blob/main/LoopCutV3.rbxmx)

# Setup:
I have tried my best to keep the usage of this plugin as simple/intuitive as possible. The initial set-up is relatively straight-forward and only consists of setting up relevant keybinds:

#### 1. Access Shortcut customization:

#### 2. Set your keybinds by searching "loop"
